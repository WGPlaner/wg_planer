## Risk Management

The Risk Management Table lists potential risks and values them regarding their impact and probability of occurrence.
Every potential risk has a "Person in Charge" assigned who keeps track of how the risks impact on the project.
The first 20 percent of the risks which have the highest risk factor get a "Risk Mitigation" which is used to prevent the risk from becoming a real problem.
