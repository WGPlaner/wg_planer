This week we worked on calculating function points and estimate the time needed for our next use cases.

### Function Points
What are function points?
The [University of Michigan](http://groups.umd.umich.edu/cis/course.des/cis375/projects/fp99/main.html) gives us some insight into how function points work. 

> Function Point is a method of estimating software project costs. By making simple estimates
> of the software you or your team plan to develop, the number of function points for your
> project can be determined. Using these function points, software developers can estimate
> various costs such as the cost in time to develop the software, or estimate the number of
> lines of code it will take to develop the software in question.

Put simply, the more complex an use case is, the more function points it gets. 

## Our use cases
We calculated function points for following existing use cases with the tool by the [University of Michigan](http://groups.umd.umich.edu/cis/course.des/cis375/projects/fp99/main.html):

 - [Add Item](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_Add_Item.md)
 - [Buy Item](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_Buy_Item.md)
 - [Invite new group member](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_Invite_New_Group_Member.md)
 - [Profile settings](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_Profile_Settings.md)
 - [Registration](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_Registration.md)
 - [Shopping List](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_Shopping_List.md)

With this information and the time we have spent so far, we were able to estimate the time needed for following use cases by simply calculating the function points with the mentioned tool.

 - [List bought items](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_List_bought_items.md)
 - [List fixed costs](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_List_fixed_costs.md)
 - [List received bills](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_List_received_bills.md)

We have uploaded an Excel file with which the time estimation was calculated. You can find it on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/FunctionPoints/FunctionPoints.xlsx).
