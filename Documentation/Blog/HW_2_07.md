# Metrics

This week is all about software metrics. 

## What are metrics?
Software metrics help developers to gain an overview over their projects.
There are simple metrics like LOC (lines of code) and more complex ones like cyclomatic complexcity.
Following site has a long list of metrics which we can only recommend:  
http://staff.unak.is/andy/StaticAnalysis0809/metrics/overview.html

### Cyclomatic complexity
"Cyclomatic complexity" is used to determine how complex a project is.
It is calculated based on the number of ways to get through the code.

> It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program’s source code.
It was developed by Thomas J. McCabe, Sr. in 1976.
> – from [Cyclomatic complexity on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity)

Methods with a high complexity are likely to be more difficult to understand and maintain.
In general the more complex the methods and functions of an application are, the more difficult it is to test the application.
To calculate the complexity, we e.g. count the number of branches in the body of the method defined as:

 - if statements
 - conditions and nested conditions
 - for statements
 - while statements

### Density of Comments | Not used
Density of Comments provides the ratio of comment lines to all lines.
The density of comments value is be between 0 and 1 and it can be used as a quality indicator
to see how much of the code is commented. You can find our comment density 
[here](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=wg_planer%3Aapp&amp;metric=comment_lines_density).
We don't use it because we think that good code speaks for itself. Furthermore, we think
that this metric is only useful for libraries with a public API because public APIs require
examples and so on. We've often seen code like this:

```
int nol = 0; // number of lines
```

This increases the density of comments but is bad code. The variable should have been
called `numberOfLines` to begin with. If you want to read more about good/clean code,
we recommend the book ["Clean Code"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Code).

## How to measure metrics?
We use [SonarQube](http://sonarqube.org/) hostet on [sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io) 
for automatic calculation of software metrics.

In the picture above we see the SonarQube overview page. It gives us insight on (possible) 
bugs, code smells vulnerabilities and more. As security is a big topic, SonarQube creates
a diagram for that as well:

You can find our sonarcloud page here: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=wg_planer%3Aapp

 - Our [cyclomatic complexity](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=wg_planer%3Aapp&amp;metric=complexity)
 - Our [comment density](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=wg_planer%3Aapp&amp;metric=comment_lines_density)

*Note:* At the moment code coverage does not work with SonarQube.

Furthermore we use codacy as we described in our [test plan](https://wgplanerblog.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/testing-test-plan/).
It tells us where problems are and how our project develops over time. Here is a screenshot of one of its diagrams:

You can find our server on codacy [here](https://app.codacy.com/project/bugwelle/wg_planer_server/dashboard)
and our android application [here](https://app.codacy.com/project/bugwelle/wg_planer/dashboard).

That’s it for this week. We hope you enjoyed our short introduction into software metrics.
